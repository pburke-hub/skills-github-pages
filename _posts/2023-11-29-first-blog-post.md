This is the content of my first & test blog post page? \(Or maybe this is the content of a blog post, and something else is needed to have a blog post appear on a page ...\)

Anyway, this content is again specified/created using Markdown Formatting, and saved to a .md file / file-extension.


End of first-blog-post page.
