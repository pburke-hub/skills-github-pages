title: Welcome to my test website for learning Jekyll / Github Pages
---

This page's content is specified by/in the index.md file. And so the content is specified through using Markdown formatting.

I think the following are okay resources about Markdown formatting:

* markdownguide.org's [Basic Syntax Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) 
* markdownguide.org's [Markdown Cheat Sheet Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
* markdownguide.org's [Getting Started Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
* Github's 'Start Writing On Github' \ ['Basic Formatting Syntax' Page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Cool. Let's end this homepage here.
